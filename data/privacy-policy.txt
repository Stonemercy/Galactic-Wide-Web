Usage of Data

The bot may use stored data, as defined below.
No usage of data outside of the aformentioned cases will happen and the data is not shared with any 3rd-party site or service.
Stored Information

The bot may store the following information automatically when being invited to a new Discord Server:
    The server's ID

Upon using the `/setup` command, the following information is stored:
    1 (one) message ID (the message is always a message posted by the bot, not anyone else)
    1 (one) channel ID (the channel that the above message was posted in)

No other information outside of the above mentioned one will be stored.


Updating Data

The data may be updated when using specific features of the bot.
Such updates of data often requires the input of a user. This data is only kept in the database and only used for its intended purpose.


Temporarely stored Information

The Bot may keep the stored information in an internal cacheing mechanic for a certain amount of time to reduce requests to its database.
After a specified time period will the cached data be discared and only re-aquired when needed.

Data may be dropped from cache pre-maturely through actions such as removing the bot from the Server.


Removal of Data
    Automatic removal

    Stored Data can be removed automatically through means of removing the bot from a Server.
    This can be achieved by using the moderation features provided by Discord.
    Re-adding the bot back to the server will store data again, as described in the Stored Information section of this policy.


    Manual removal

    Manual removal of the data can be requested through the official Support Discord of the Bot.
    For security reasons will we ask you to provide us with proof of ownership of the server, that you wish the data to be removed of. 
    Only a server owner may request manual removal of data and requesting it will result in the bot being removed from the server, if still present on it.
